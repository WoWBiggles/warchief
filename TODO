Web interface to interact with vMangos accounts:

	- Create new accounts:
		x Email verification (optional)
		x IP checks (optional, GeoIP or IP blacklisting)
		x Take into account banned ips table
		x Password validation (NormalizedString requirements, use htmx for this)
		x ReCaptcha (optional)
		- Logs of login attempts (add new table to realmd via sqlx migrations)

	- Login and manage accounts / view characters:
		x Take into account banned accounts table
		x Change password
		- View realm list
		- View characters on realms (optional if mangos db connection provided)

	- GM:
	 	- Search by account username / characters on account.
		- View characters by name and linked accounts (optional if mangos db connection provided)
		- See logins by IP
		- See user stats split by country
		- View flagged accounts (logins with multiple IPs from multiple countries?)
		- View/modify IP ban lists

	- Improvements:
	 	- Extract controller logic from routes
			- Controllers should return `thiserror` enums, routes should handle errors and return templates.
			- Especially useful for login attempt logging, can extract logic to a controller and then add error wrapping.
		- Cleanup UI/CSS (replace with maud + htmx, maybe add tailwind)
		- Add more wow borders
		- Add config options for everything
		- Cleanup verification tokens over time (crate for that?)
